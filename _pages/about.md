I'm a fourth-year CS student at Peking University, working with Prof. Yisen Wang, Prof. Lin Yang, and Prof. Amy Zhang. My research goal is to design more powerful and efficient algorithms in reinforcement learning and to provide theoretical understanding for existing representation learning paradigms.
