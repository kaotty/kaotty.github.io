I'm a fourth-year CS student at Peking University, working with Prof. Yisen Wang and Prof. Lin Yang. My research goal is to design more powerful and efficient algorithms in reinforcement learning and to provide theoretical understanding for existing representation learning paradigms. My latest CV is [here](http://kaotty.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

## Research Interests
- Representation Learning: Revisiting the existing deep learning (e.g., self-supervised learning) paradigms and uncover their underlying mechanisms theoretically.

- Reinforcement Learning: Improving the sample efficiency of multiple settings with guarantees of robustness.


## News
- 2024.10: Our paper on contrastive learning theory is submitted to ICLR 2025.
- 2024.09: Our paper on equivariant self-supervised learning theory is accepted at NeurIPS 2024!
