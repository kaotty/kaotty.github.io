I'm a fourth-year CS student at Peking University, working with Prof. Yisen Wang and Prof. Lin Yang. My research goal is to design more powerful and efficient algorithms in reinforcement learning and to provide theoretical understanding for existing representation learning paradigms.
## Research Interests
Representation Learning: Revisiting the existing deep learning (e.g., self-supervised learning) paradigms and uncover their underlying mechanisms theoretically.
Reinforcement Learning: Improving the sample efficiency of multiple settings with guarantees of robustness.

## Hobbies
Beyond academics, I have a keen interest in sports, particularly tennis. I served as the captain of the School of EECS tennis team, where we made numerous victories togeter. I'm also the president of the Peking University Student Tennis Association, where I've organized several tennis tournaments and classes.
