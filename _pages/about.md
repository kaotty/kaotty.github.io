I'm a first-year PhD student at UC Berkeley EECS, advised by Prof. Somayeh Sojoudi. I got my BS in computer science from Peking University previously, working with Prof. Yisen Wang and Dr. Yifei Wang on self-supervised learning and Prof. Lin Yang (UCLA) on reinforcement learning. My current research interests are self-supervised learning, reinforcement learning and LLM reasoning. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaboration!

My CV is [here](http://kaotty.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

## Research Interests
- Reasoning in LLMs: Understanding the causes of reasoning failures in large language models and solving them via reliable and robust methods.
- Self-Supervised Learning: Revisiting the existing self-supervised learning paradigms and uncovering their underlying mechanisms theoretically.
- Reinforcement Learning: Developing scalable RL algorithms and applying them to applications like LLMs.
